DID makes it possible for data ownership to return to individuals, but for users to actively manage and protect personal data, it is necessary to complete the assetization of data elements, that is, data can generate revenue for them in the future and complete the marketization of data elements . There are four steps to the marketization of data elements: data confirmation, data pricing, data circulation and data transactions.

Regarding the confirmation of data elements, data assets can be divided into public data and private data by the definition of property rights; public data embody the characteristics of public welfare, which should be mainly free; and private data can be based on market pricing.

In terms of data element pricing, the data structure can be divided into structured data and unstructured data. Structured data is characterized by easy identification and high standardization. Structured data can be priced uniformly; unstructured data is not easy to identify. There is no uniform standard, and unstructured data should be priced by auction due to its low replaceability.

In the circulation of data elements, data elements are different from traditional assets. Traditional assets are consumable, but data elements have the characteristics of being reproducible and can be used for an unlimited number of times. Therefore, the circulation of data elements can ensure that the ownership of data remains unchanged, and only transfer the right to use the data.

In terms of data element transactions, the information between the data seller and the buyer is asymmetric, the seller is more aware of the data quality, and the buyer is completely unable to evaluate, and the two are more prone to unfair transactions; for the asymmetric transaction information, American economist Akeroff He has specifically discussed in the article, and thus won the Nobel Prize in Economics. The general idea is that under asymmetric information, if the buyer's bid is too low, it is difficult to reach the psychological price of the good car seller, the price mechanism will drive them to leave the market, and the rest of the market is inferior cars. Under adverse selection, inferior cars flood and fraud Prevail.

The problems faced by the data element market can ultimately be attributed to the following:

How to define public data and personal data?

How to classify data structure?

How to realize the circulation of data use rights?

How to identify data quality?


The definition of data property rights is the premise of the data's exchange. The legal level clearly defines all data subjects, which can ensure the legality and validity of the exchange between the two parties. Blockchain-based DID identity system is technically clear Data ownership, public data ownership is managed by organizations such as government or enterprises, and personal data is managed by individual Person DID management.


In terms of data structure processing, taking medical data as an example, medical and health data includes hospital electronic medical records (EMR) and the data of personal life. The electronic medical record data mainly includes medical image data, electronic medical record and physical health examination data; personal data mainly includes data such as exercise and heart rate. They can be divided into structured data and unstructured data, which have different pricing mechanisms. However, they all use off-chain storage and on-chain verification to ensure the authenticity and privacy of the data.
