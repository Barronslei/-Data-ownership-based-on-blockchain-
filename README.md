DID在技术上让数据所有权回归个人成为可能，但要让用户主动管理和保护个人数据，需要完成数据要素的资产化，即用户可以看到自己的数据未来可以产生收益，完成数据要素的市场化。数据要素的市场化有四个环节：数据确权、数据定价、数据流通和数据交易。

在数据要素确权方面，以产权属性界定，数据资产可分为公共数据和私人数据；公共数据体现公益特性，当以免费为主；私人数据则可按市场定价为主。

在数据要素定价方面，以数据结构分类，可以分为结构化数据和非结构化数据，结构化数据的特点是易识别、标准化高，结构化数据可以统一标准定价；非结构化数据不易识别，不具有统一标准，非结构化数据由于可替代性低，应该以拍卖方式定价。

在数据要素流通上，数据要素不同于传统资产，传统资产具有易耗性，但是数据要素具有可复制、不限次数使用的特性，因此，数据要素流通上，可以保证数据所有权不变的条件下，只转让数据的使用权。

在数据要素交易方面，数据卖方和买方之间信息不对称，卖方更清楚数据质量，买方则完全无法评价，两者更易发生不公平交易；对于交易信息不对称，美国经济学家阿克洛夫曾在文章专门论述，并因此还获得了诺贝尔经济学奖。大意是，在信息不对称下，若买方出价过低，难以达到好车卖方的心理价位，价格机制将驱使他们离开市场，市场剩下的都是劣质车，逆向选择下，劣质车泛滥，欺诈盛行。

数据要素市场面临的问题最终可以归结为以下几项：
	
  如何界定公共数据和个人数据？
  
  如何对数据结构分类？
  
  如何实现数据使用权的流通？
  
  如何甄别数据质量？




DID makes it possible for data ownership to return to individuals, but for users to actively manage and protect personal data, it is necessary to complete the assetization of data elements, that is, data can generate revenue for them in the future and complete the marketization of data elements . There are four steps to the marketization of data elements: data confirmation, data pricing, data circulation and data transactions.

Regarding the confirmation of data elements, data assets can be divided into public data and private data by the definition of property rights; public data embody the characteristics of public welfare, which should be mainly free; and private data can be based on market pricing.

In terms of data element pricing, the data structure can be divided into structured data and unstructured data. Structured data is characterized by easy identification and high standardization. Structured data can be priced uniformly; unstructured data is not easy to identify. There is no uniform standard, and unstructured data should be priced by auction due to its low replaceability.

In the circulation of data elements, data elements are different from traditional assets. Traditional assets are consumable, but data elements have the characteristics of being reproducible and can be used for an unlimited number of times. Therefore, the circulation of data elements can ensure that the ownership of data remains unchanged, and only transfer the right to use the data.

In terms of data element transactions, the information between the data seller and the buyer is asymmetric, the seller is more aware of the data quality, and the buyer is completely unable to evaluate, and the two are more prone to unfair transactions; for the asymmetric transaction information, American economist Akeroff He has specifically discussed in the article, and thus won the Nobel Prize in Economics. The general idea is that under asymmetric information, if the buyer's bid is too low, it is difficult to reach the psychological price of the good car seller, the price mechanism will drive them to leave the market, and the rest of the market is inferior cars. Under adverse selection, inferior cars flood and fraud Prevail.

The problems faced by the data element market can ultimately be attributed to the following:

How to define public data and personal data?

How to classify data structure?

How to realize the circulation of data use rights?

How to identify data quality?
